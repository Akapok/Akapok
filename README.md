## Hey you ðŸ˜Ž

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Front-end developer, working from France.
I love to code with EmberJs and VueJs, create small projects about sciences and knowledge sharing.

### ðŸŒ± Currently learning:

- Deployment of an EmberJs app. Because I work with already set up projects every day, it's easy to forget the basics.
- Testing with Vitest
- Breton, a celtic language from Britanny. So I'll be able to speak with my grandmother using her native langage.
